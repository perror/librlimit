Here a few items that (may) need to be completed in the future versions:

***** src/ *****
* [feature] Provide a more efficient data-structure to store and
  access the syscalls.

* [feature] Get rid of chars when getting stdout/stderr and consider
  it as bytes (more generic way).

* [bugfix] Passing an environment doesn't seem to work properly. This
  need to be looked at.


***** doc/ *****
* [feature] Write a documentation of the main procedures of the API
  (manpages with troff).


Future milestones
