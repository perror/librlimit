Here a few items that (may) need to be completed in the future versions:

***** python/ *****
* [feature] Provide a Python binding (I need it for later).


***** src/ *****
* [bug] Writing on the input of a subprocess do not seems to work.

* [bug] Poll the stdout/stderr and store the result in memory (for
  now, we are relying on the file descriptor's buffer which has a
  limited size (4kb)).

* [feature] Provide a more efficient data-structure to store and
  access the syscalls.


***** test/ *****
* [feature] Set up a test framework that can check each feature and
  particular settings (trying to avoid regression).


***** doc/ *****
* [feature] Write a documentation of the main procedures of the API
  (manpages with troff).
