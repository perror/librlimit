Here a few items that (may) need to be completed in the future versions:

***** python/ *****
* Provide a Python binding (I need it for later).


***** src/ *****

* Poll the stdout/stderr and store the result in memory (for now, we
  are relying on the file descriptor's buffer which has a limited size
  (4kb)).

* Provide a more efficient data-structure to store and access the
  syscalls.


***** test/ *****
* Set up a test framework that can check each feature and particular
  settings (trying to avoid regression).


***** doc/ *****
* Write a documentation of the man procedures of the API (manpages with troff).
