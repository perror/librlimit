Here a few items that (may) need to be completed in the future versions:

***** python/ *****
* [feature] Provide a full Python API connected to librlimit.so
  through the Python ctypes module.


***** src/ *****
* [feature] Provide a more efficient data-structure to store and
  access the syscalls.


***** test/ *****
* [feature] Set up a test framework that can check each feature and
  particular settings (trying to avoid regression).


***** doc/ *****
* [feature] Write a documentation of the main procedures of the API
  (manpages with troff).


Future milestones
